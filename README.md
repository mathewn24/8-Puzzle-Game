# 8-Puzzle-Game
This is a C++ implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game in the CLI. The game requires you to enter a seed value to generate a randomized puzzle, after which you can play the game. If you solve the puzzle in less than 30 rounds you will see a "Well done!" message, and if you exceed a 100 rounds the program will terminate.
